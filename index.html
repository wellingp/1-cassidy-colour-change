               <p>David doesn't have many hobbies, though he skies and goes scuba diving when he can.</p>

               <p>He spends most of his time off playing the guitar, sitting on his amp, at his new house in Encino listening to Steven Stills, Neil Young and David Crosby, imitating the songs.</p>

               <p>And writing songs of his own.</p>

               <img src="images/bio-david4.jpg" alt="">

               <p>To date, David has recorded only one of them: "Ricky's Tune," a song about his recently deceased dog.</p>

               <p>In a corner, a pile of gifts from fans four feet high: stuffed animals, plastic flowers, incense and scented candles, shirts and hand-printed messages of undying love.</p>

               <p>David signed autographs for promoters' and policemen's daughters, and chatted with well wishers. It was a high moment for him; a triumph, he called it.</p>

               <p>"Here I am," he said. "I've arrived."</p>
